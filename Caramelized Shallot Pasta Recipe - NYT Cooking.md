Michael Graydon & Nikole Herriott for The New York Times. Prop Stylist: Kalen Kaminski.

This pasta is all about the shallots, cooked down in a bath of olive oil to a jammy, caramelized paste. Tomato paste is there for tanginess, and anchovies for saltiness, but they serve more as background flavors to the sweetness of the shallot. This recipe makes enough caramelized shallot mixture for a double batch of pasta, or simply keep it refrigerated to spoon over fried eggs, or to serve underneath crispy chicken thighs or over roasted root vegetables like carrots or sweet potatoes.

Delicious!

### Ingredients

* ¼ cup olive oil
* 6 large shallots, very thinly sliced
* 5 garlic cloves, 4 thinly sliced, 1 finely chopped
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more to taste
* 1 (2-ounce) can anchovy fillets (about 12), drained
* 1 (4.5-ounce) tube or (6-ounce) can of tomato paste (about 1/2 to 3/4 cup)
* 10 ounces pasta
* 1 cup parsley, leaves and tender stems, finely chopped
* Flaky sea salt

[Ingredient Substitution Guide](https://cooking.nytimes.com/guides/79-substitutions-for-cooking)

### Preparation

1. Heat olive oil in a large heavy-bottomed Dutch oven over medium high. Add shallots and thinly sliced garlic, and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the shallots have become totally softened and caramelized with golden-brown fried edges, 15 to 20 minutes.
2. Add red-pepper flakes and anchovies. (No need to chop the anchovies; they will dissolve on their own.) Stir to melt the anchovies into the shallots, about 2 minutes.
3. Add tomato paste and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly to prevent any scorching, until the tomato paste has started to cook in the oil a bit, caramelizing at the edges and going from bright red to a deeper brick red color, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and transfer about half the mixture to a resealable container, leaving the rest behind. (These are your leftovers to be used elsewhere: in another batch of pasta or smeared onto roasted vegetables, spooned over fried eggs or spread underneath crispy chicken thighs.)
4. To serve, cook pasta according to package instructions in a large pot of salted boiling water until very al dente (perhaps more al dente than usual). Transfer to Dutch oven with remaining shallot mixture (or a skillet if you are using the leftover portion) and 1 cup pasta water. Cook over medium-high heat, swirling the skillet to coat each piece of pasta, using a wooden spoon or spatula to scrape up any bits on the bottom, until pasta is thick and sauce has reduced and is sticky, but not saucy, 3 to 5 minutes.
5. In a small bowl, combine parsley and finely chopped garlic clove, and season with flaky salt and pepper. Divide pasta among bowls, or transfer to one large serving bowl, and top with parsley mixture and a bit more red-pepper flakes, if you like.

You could replace anchovies with a kalamata olive tapenade and/or reconstitute some sun-dried tomatoes in water and fine chop.

I'm surprised at the medium-high heat recommended for caramelizing the shallots. In my experience, shallots are much more sensitive to cooking temperature than onions — and are prone to burn if cooked too quickly. I'd suggest turning the heat down just as soon as the shallots have begun to sizzle a bit — otherwise they'll be burned well before they've fully caramelized.

As one of the Instagram messengers who asked for this — with zero expectation —thank you times a million! For those asking for an anchovy substitute, that’s kinda like reading a recipe for olive oil cake and then asking what can be used instead. I’d try with a smaller amount Of anchovies — even just 1 or 2 — and work your way up. Cooked like this they somehow both disappear into subtlety while exploding with savoriness. I used to think I hated anchovies, but I don’t anymore thanks to Alison.

It's tedious searching for notes from cooks who prepared the actual recipe. Questions & ideas for changes have a place here, but it's most helpful for me to hear from those who have actually used a recipe. Some sites -- Smitten Kitchen, e.g. -- let one separate comments from those who have cooked a recipe from those who have other things to say. "Most Helpful" is not quite the same. Could you revise the Cooking Notes section -- Questions, Variations, Cooked As Is, perhaps?

The things you learn... Preparing this tonight. Local market had choice of Hunts Tomato Paste and Hunts No-Salt-Added Tomato Paste. With salt from the anchovies and that used in caramelization, wanted to be careful with additional salt. Bought both and decided I'd figure it out later. Back home, I checked ingredients and nutritional values. Want to know the difference between the two? The labeling! Nothing else. Otherwise identical. It's just marketing. Who'd a thunk it? Caveat emptor

On Instagram earlier today, Alison Roman said (in so many words) this dish is all about the anchovies so do not ask about an anchovy substitute, just make a different pasta dish.

i want to know how anyone can cook thinly sliced garlic, over medium heat, for 15-20 minutes without them burning to a bitter mess. no, i don't think so. i would add them maybe 5 minutes before the end of the cooking process. this is like recipes that say to cook onions until caramelized.. 10 -15 minutes. in your dreams, plan 30 - 45 or more minutes for that.

This was insanely good. Completely addictive, just kept wanting to go back for more long after I was full. Made it exactly according to the recipe, used spaghetti. I always thought I didn’t like anchovies until I started using NYT cooking.

So can anybody who has had success with recipe tell me about how much in grams or ounces you need for the shallots. Large means nothing to me. It is a shame that people who write recipes like this for mass consumption can not be more specific on the amounts of ingredients.

Anchovies cooked taste almost nothing like anchovies out of the can. If you are worried about it, reduce the quantity. If you want to eliminate them completely, it won't taste the same. Be brave!

Anchovies are a concentrated umami source. The closest substitute is fish sauce, as Andrew points out: see Harold McGee's "On Food and Cooking". The Romans' fish sauce was called Garum: after it went out of fashion, anchovies replaced it - both are fermented fish products. If you're vegan, use fermented soybean paste or miso, which are more intense than soy sauce. (Olives and capers are nice, but lack umami, which is due to savory amino acids, primarily glutamate, from a protein source.)

Zest of one lemon, plus the juice of 1/2 mixed into the sauce prior to pasta tossing is a nice plus!

For the truly anchovy averse, try a tube of anchovy paste. It keeps in the fridge forever, and you can just squirt in a dab, without having to open a whole can for a small amount and the yuck factor is gone. It's basically just a tube of flavor, and is frankly delicious. Not quite the same as the real thing, but pretty darn close.

Since I’m a vegetarian I have replaced anchovies with a mix of any or all well of pitted olives, pickled gherkins and pickled capers. A handful of Button mushrooms finely chopped adds bulk to the sauce! It turned out to be delicious!

This recipe is a delight! It is inexpensive to make and tastes wonderful. I used a very large macaroni type of pasta and ended up using the whole contents of the shallot-paste-sauce. It was wonderful. I cried a lot when I cut up all of the shallots. Like, a lot. But if felt cathartic and it was totally worth it in the end.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this dish! I followed the recipe almost exactly with two super minor changes: 1. caramelized the shallots over low heat (instead of medium high). 2. Cooked the bag of 16 oz pasta then combined it with the sauce (instead of reserving 1/2 for later as suggested by the recipe, which seemed a bit strange). Will definitely be making this regularly.
