You came close with attempt 2. What you need to do is spread the popcorn out in a thick layer on a parchment-lined baking sheet. When you've made the caramel according to the recipe, drizzle it over the popcorn and then give it a quick light stir before it hardens, just to get a bit of caramel on each piece of popcorn.

Once it's begun to cool to where it's not fully hard but it's no longer quite so sticky, give it another stir to break it up. This is how you avoid a big chunk. Good luck.

EDIT: Here's my complete recipe, comes out perfect every time. This shouldn't be a complicated process, just follow the instructions and you should get good results. No need for a thermometer.

1 cup sugar

1/2 cup water

1 stick butter

1 tsp baking soda

1/2 cup popcorn kernels

Salt to taste

Pop up the popcorn and spread it out in a thick layer on a parchment lined baking sheet.

Bring the water to a boil and then add the sugar. Let this mixture simmer on medium heat until it turns a deep rich brown. Don't stir! Just be patient and let it do its thing. The longer you leave it, the   darker and more flavourful the caramel will get. You'll figure out what's to your taste after making a batch or two, but for me I like mine nice and dark.

When the caramel gets to your liking, add the stick of butter and blend it together. Then add the teaspoon of baking soda. Get ready, because it will fizz up fast. Drizzle over the popcorn and give it a gentle stir here and there to get a bit of caramel on every popcorn piece. Sprinkle quickly with a bit of flake salt to give it a bit of crunch on the popcorn.

Once it has cooled to the touch but hasn't fully hardened, give it another good stir to break it up. It stores well (if it lasts that long, it's pretty addictive), but if you're giving it as a gift use plastic or glass rather than paper - the butter will leak through the paper.

Clean-up is easy, just fill the pot with water and the residual caramel will melt away.

This is my own recipe. I only use as much water is needed to dissolve the sugar and start it safely melting/cooking without burning it. The rest of the time you're just basically waiting for the water to evaporate from the mixture. Don't stir or it will crystallize. Once the water evaporates, that's when it really starts caramelizing.

Don't worry about the consistency. All you need to do is watch the color. The consistency will happen naturally when you add the butter and baking soda. When it gets to a deep dark golden brown - when you start to think "oh no, this is going to burn" - then you add the butter. Once the butter is melted, add the baking soda. It will rapidly fizz up and expand at that point, to a large volume of caramel to pour over the corn.
